## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

Hello! This project is an educational demo for learning and exploring the **App Router** in Next.js. The main focus is on **rendering strategies** (such as Server-Side Rendering, Client-Side Rendering, Static Rendering, and Streaming).

This project is still **in development** (WIP), and I'm working on it as a Next.js learner. The goal is to implement and test rendering concepts step by step. If you spot any issues or have suggestions, I'd love to hear them! ðŸ˜Š

### Why This Project?
- **Hands-On Learning**: Each code section demonstrates a rendering concept.
- **Modern and Up-to-Date**: Built on Next.js 14+ and App Router.
- **Simple and Expandable**: Starts from the standard Next.js boilerplate, with advanced features coming soon.

## ðŸš€ Current Features (and Future Ones)
- âœ… **Server Components** as the default for server-side rendering.
- âœ… **Client Components** with `'use client'` for client-side interactions.
- ðŸ”„ **Static Rendering** with `export const dynamic = 'force-static';`.
- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Rendering** based on user requests.
- ðŸ”„ **Streaming** with `<Suspense>` for better loading experiences.
- ðŸ”„ **Parallel Routes** and **Intercepting Routes** (in progress).
- ðŸ”„ **Error Handling** and **Custom Loading States**.

Currently, the home page (`app/page.tsx`) shows a simple Server Component example. More pages will be added soon!

## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ or higher
- npm/yarn/pnpm/bun (whichever you prefer)
